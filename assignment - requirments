# Case Study: Scalable and Secure Client Reporting  
_A Senior Data & Reporting Analyst Assignment_

## 📍 Context  
We are a fast-growing Patient Advocacy Group (PAG) supporting individuals with a variety of medical conditions. We collaborate with healthcare clients like United Healthcare and Humana, providing insights into patient treatment trends and outcomes. Internally, our stakeholders include program managers and senior leadership who rely on consistent, trustworthy reporting.

Our data ecosystem is undergoing modernization and currently includes:  
- PostgreSQL reporting data warehouse  
- ETL pipelines managed with **Airflow**  
- Transition from legacy SQL scripts to **DBT**  
- Dashboards built in **Tableau** with planned role-based access  
- Programming primarily in **SQL**  
- Strong focus on **HIPAA** compliance and data privacy

## 🧩 Your Role  
As a **Senior Data & Reporting Analyst**, your task is to improve internal and external reporting by working with messy real-world data and building stakeholder-driven, scalable solutions.

The provided dataset includes mock data (e.g. procedures, insurance info, anonymized metadata), already loaded into the data warehouse.

Deliverables can be in **Markdown** or **PDF** format.
