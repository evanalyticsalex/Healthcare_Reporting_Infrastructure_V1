# üíä MyTomorrows ‚Äì Scalable & Secure Client Reporting
_A case study for a growing Patient Advocacy Group_

## üéØ Objective
Design a scalable, secure, and privacy-compliant reporting workflow to support both internal and client-facing analytics in a healthcare-focused environment.

---

## üìå Very Important Information About Deliverables

Each task deliverable has been named **exactly as requested**, following the required naming convention:
- Task 1 ‚Üí `D1.A`, `D1.B`, etc.
- Task 2 ‚Üí `D2.A`, `D2.B`, etc.

This ensures full alignment with submission guidelines and allows for quick referencing and review.

## üß∞ Tooling & Workflow Adjustments

<details>
<summary><strong>üõ†Ô∏è Initial Plan</strong></summary>

The original architecture involved:
- Loading the dataset into **PostgreSQL**
- Transforming it using **DBT**
- Orchestrating the pipeline with **Airflow**
- Visualizing with **Tableau**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîÑ Adapted Approach</strong></summary>

Due to local environment constraints and time sensitivity, I adapted the setup to focus on delivering the **core value** of the assignment using accessible tools.

</details>

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Modeling & Transformation

<details>
<summary><strong>üß™ Tools Used</strong></summary>

- **DBeaver** (as SQL interface)
- **SQLite** (lightweight local database)
- **CSV files** (as source data)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üß† Why DBeaver + SQLite?</strong></summary>

This combination allowed me to:
- Quickly **explore** and **understand** the dataset
- Test **joins**, **filters**, and **business logic**
- Visualize relationships before moving to a production-grade setup

> I treated this as a "sandbox phase" ‚Äî experiment first, then scale to PostgreSQL + DBT as a theoretical proposal.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Notes</strong></summary>

- Created schemas manually in DBeaver
- Modeled key views to simulate reporting layers
- Converted views to tables where SQLite limitations required it

</details>

---

## üìä Visualization Layer

<details>
<summary><strong>üñ•Ô∏è Tools Used</strong></summary>

- **Tableau (local version)**
- **Excel (as data connector)**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìà Why Excel?</strong></summary>

My local Tableau version does not support live database connections. As a workaround:
- Transformed views were exported as Excel files
- Used those as the data source for dashboarding
- Created mockups and walkthroughs where interactivity was limited

</details>

---

## üîç Focus Areas

- ‚úÖ Data pipeline design and modeling strategy
- ‚úÖ Privacy-aware reporting (e.g., anonymization for external use)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard logic, filters, and UX for internal/external stakeholders

---

Even though I didn‚Äôt implement a full production-grade stack, this case study reflects **my analytical thinking**, **data design decisions**, and how I **adapt to constraints** to deliver insight-driven solutions.

# üìÅ Task 1 - Client-Facing Report for UnitedHealthcare

## üìå Summary of the Assignment

UnitedHealthcare, as a client of a Patient Advocacy Group, requested a secure and standardized report that helps them:

- Understand and group procedures into consistent categories
- Identify high-volume procedures
- Flag missed patients, especially those without insurance
- Export the data sorted by procedure and latest date
- Receive insights via Tableau dashboards without exposing PII

# üîê D1.C ‚Äì Filters and Permissions for Secure Client Access

## üßÆ SQL-Level Row-Level Security (RLS)

- `WHERE client = 'United Healthcare'`
- Apply via:
- **Secure View** in PostgreSQL
- or within a **DBT model** with client-specific logic
- Ensures data is **filtered before reaching Tableau**
- Supports compliance with **HIPAA** and internal data segmentation rules

---

## üìä Tableau-Level Permissions

### üë• User Group Segmentation
- Create user group: `Client_UHC`
- Assign **United Healthcare users** to this group via Tableau Server

### üîé Data Source Filters
- Apply formula:
```tableau
ISMEMBEROF('Client_UHC')
```

- Restricts dashboard visibility to rows matching that client

### üï∂Ô∏è Hide PII Fields
- Drop or mask Personally Identifiable Information:
- Done at **SQL level** (DBT or source view)
- Tableau **never sees** raw PII data

---

## üì§ Export Limitation & Access Control

- **CSV export** allowed *only* from sanitized, aggregated tables
- Avoid joins to any table containing PII
- Use **Tableau Server permissions** to:
- Restrict export capabilities by role
- Limit access to download options per dashboard

---

| Layer   | Technique                         | Purpose                            |
|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| SQL     | Row-Level Security in DBT/View    | Pre-filter data by client          |
| Tableau | User Groups + Data Source Filters | Restrict visibility per user group |
| Export  | Server-level CSV restrictions     | Prevent PII leakage on download    |
