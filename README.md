## üìå Deliverables Naming Convention  

Each deliverable is named as required:  
- Task 1 ‚Üí `D1.A`, `D1.B`, etc.  
- Task 2 ‚Üí `D2.A`, `D2.B`, etc.

## üß† Task 1: Build a Client-Facing Report (United Healthcare)

UnitedHealthcare requested a secure, standardized view of their patient data. The objectives were:

- Standardize insurance coverage for treatments (group similar procedures)  
- Identify high-volume procedures and patients missed (especially uninsured)  
- Export the data sorted by procedure and latest procedure date  
- Receive data visualizations via Tableau, without exposing patient PII

## ‚úÖ Why This Structure?

- Each layer is clean, logical, and reusable  
- Modular views make debugging and future development easier  
- Mimics DBT-style transformations, enabling lineage tracking  
- Designed with privacy and export-readiness in mind  
- Ideal for use in Tableau or other BI tools

# D1.D: Anonymization, Grouping, and Export Logic

## üîê Anonymization

To comply with HIPAA and internal privacy regulations, the following steps are implemented in the DBT transformation layer:

- **Patient ID Hashing:** Replace patient identifiers with a salted hash using SHA256 for consistent but anonymous tracking.

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql 
SELECT
  SHA256(CONCAT(patient_id, 'secure_salt')) AS hashed_patient_id
FROM patients
```
</details>

- **DOB Bucketing:** Convert `patients.date_of_birth` into non-identifiable age buckets for analysis.

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
CASE
  WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN '20-29'
  WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
  ELSE '40+'
END AS age_bucket
```
</details>

- **PII Exclusion:** Drop fields such as `name`, `address`, and exact `date_of_birth` from reporting views.

## üì¶ Grouping (Procedure Standardization)

Standardize procedure types for clearer client reporting and analytics by grouping procedure codes.

Using the `procedures` table:

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  procedure_id,
  encounter_id,
  procedure_code,
  CASE
    WHEN procedure_code IN ('X123', 'X124') THEN 'Knee Surgery'
    WHEN procedure_code IN ('Y201', 'Y202') THEN 'Heart Monitoring'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS procedure_group,
  procedure_date
FROM procedures
```
</details>

This view (`procedure_grouped`) can then be joined with `encounters`, `payers`, and `transformed_patients`.

## üì§ Export Logic (Client View)

For example, to meet the needs of United Healthcare, a DBT model (`client_uhc_export`) aggregates and exports a de-identified, grouped dataset:

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  pg.procedure_group,
  tp.hashed_patient_id,
  p.coverage_type,
  MAX(pg.procedure_date) AS latest_procedure_date
FROM procedure_grouped pg
JOIN encounters e ON pg.encounter_id = e.encounter_id
JOIN transformed_patients tp ON e.patient_id = tp.patient_id
JOIN payers p ON e.payer_id = p.payer_id
WHERE p.client = 'United Healthcare'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC
```
</details>

This model serves as a Tableau extract source, ensuring client visibility without compromising patient privacy.
