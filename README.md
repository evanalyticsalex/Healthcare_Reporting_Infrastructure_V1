## üß† Task 1: Build a Client-Facing Report (United Healthcare)

UnitedHealthcare requested a secure, standardized view of their patient data. The objectives were:

- Standardize insurance coverage for treatments (group similar procedures)  
- Identify high-volume procedures and patients missed (especially uninsured)  
- Export the data sorted by procedure and latest procedure date  
- Receive data visualizations via Tableau, without exposing patient PII

# D1.D: Anonymization, Grouping, and Export Logic

## üîê Anonymization

To comply with HIPAA and internal privacy regulations, the following steps are implemented in the DBT transformation layer:

- **Patient ID Hashing:** Replace patient identifiers with a salted hash using SHA256 for consistent but anonymous tracking.

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql 
SELECT
  SHA256(CONCAT(patient_id, 'secure_salt')) AS hashed_patient_id
FROM patients
```
</details>

- **DOB Bucketing:** Convert `patients.date_of_birth` into non-identifiable age buckets for analysis.

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
CASE
  WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 20 AND 29 THEN '20-29'
  WHEN DATE_PART('year', AGE(CURRENT_DATE, date_of_birth)) BETWEEN 30 AND 39 THEN '30-39'
  ELSE '40+'
END AS age_bucket
```
</details>

- **PII Exclusion:** Drop fields such as `name`, `address`, and exact `date_of_birth` from reporting views.

## üì¶ Grouping (Procedure Standardization)

Standardize procedure types for clearer client reporting and analytics by grouping procedure codes.

Using the `procedures` table:

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
SELECT
  procedure_id,
  encounter_id,
  procedure_code,
  CASE
    WHEN procedure_code IN ('X123', 'X124') THEN 'Knee Surgery'
    WHEN procedure_code IN ('Y201', 'Y202') THEN 'Heart Monitoring'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS procedure_group,
  procedure_date
FROM procedures
```
</details>

This view (`procedure_grouped`) can then be joined with `encounters`, `payers`, and `transformed_patients`.

## üì§ Export Logic (Client View)

For example, to meet the needs of United Healthcare, a DBT model (`client_uhc_export`) aggregates and exports a de-identified, grouped dataset:

<details>
<summary>SQL Example Hypothetical</summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  pg.procedure_group,
  tp.hashed_patient_id,
  p.coverage_type,
  MAX(pg.procedure_date) AS latest_procedure_date
FROM procedure_grouped pg
JOIN encounters e ON pg.encounter_id = e.encounter_id
JOIN transformed_patients tp ON e.patient_id = tp.patient_id
JOIN payers p ON e.payer_id = p.payer_id
WHERE p.client = 'United Healthcare'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 1, 4 DESC
```
</details>

This model serves as a Tableau extract source, ensuring client visibility without compromising patient privacy.

## üß† Task  2: Internal Report for Multi-Specialty Hospital Team (Humana)

# D2.A ‚Äî Technical Setup

### Data Architecture
- **Data Warehouse**: PostgreSQL used for centralized, structured reporting
- **ETL Management**: Airflow schedules raw data ingestion and DBT model runs
- **Transformation Logic**:
  - `fct_procedures`: fact table with patient, procedure, specialty, and timestamp data
  - `dim_specialties`: links procedures to their medical specialty
  - `dim_authorizations`: maps users to specialties and hospice treatment access
  - `fct_patients_helped`: time-bound aggregation of patient counts per specialty
- **Visualization**: Tableau connected via a service account with role-based row-level security
- **Compliance**: All pipelines and outputs designed with HIPAA-compliant anonymization (hashed patient IDs, no direct identifiers)

# D2.B ‚Äî Dashboard Layout

| Section                      | Functionality                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Specialty Filter**        | Dropdown sourced from `dim_specialties`, scoped by user's access rights      |
| **Date Range Filter**       | Relative date filter (last 7/30/90 days or custom range)                      |
| **Patient Summary Tiles**   | KPIs: total patients helped, avg per specialty, % change from previous period |
| **Procedure Breakdown**     | Bar chart: patient count by procedure (filtered by specialty & time)         |
| **Hospice Treatments**      | Hidden section: visible only to authorized users (based on RLS and permissions) |
| **Trends Over Time**        | Line chart: patients helped per month per specialty                          |

All charts and filters respect underlying permission controls.

---

# D2.C ‚Äî Permissions & Privacy Integration

### 1. **Hospice Data Restrictions**
- `procedure_type = 'hospice'` is flagged in DBT models
- Users with `is_hospice_authorized = TRUE` in `dim_authorizations` can access hospice data
- **Enforced via**:
  - Row-level security (RLS) in Tableau: `CASE WHEN is_hospice_authorized THEN TRUE ELSE procedure_type != 'hospice'`
  - Filter-level logic in DBT to minimize exposure before Tableau

### 2. **Specialty-Based Filtering**
- Each user is mapped to allowed specialties in `dim_authorizations`
- DBT applies early filtering using `WHERE specialty IN (user_allowed_specialties)`
- Tableau respects the scoped data based on user role context

### 3. **Timeframe Tracking**
- `fct_patients_helped` aggregates patient data by specialty, procedure, and date
- Allows consistent tracking and visualization over dynamic periods

### 4. **Privacy Safeguards**
- Pseudonymization of patient identifiers at ingestion
- No names, contact details, or direct PII in any layer
- Tableau and PostgreSQL access logged for auditability
- Use of service accounts with least privilege access model

## Summary

This internal reporting setup for Humana ensures specialty-specific usability, sensitive data protection, and regulatory compliance, built on a scalable stack using PostgreSQL, DBT, Airflow, and Tableau.
